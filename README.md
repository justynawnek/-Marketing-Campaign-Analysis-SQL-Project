# üìä Marketing Campaign Analysis SQL Project

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze marketing campaign data from Facebook and Google Ads using SQL. The main objective is to transform raw data into actionable insights by calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPC, CPM, CTR, and ROMI. The analysis also includes identifying top-performing campaigns and ad sets, analyzing UTM campaigns, tracking monthly performance trends, and segmenting performance by various dimensions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Highlights
- **SQL CTEs and Window Functions:** Leveraged Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions to organize complex queries and perform trend analyses.
- **Data Aggregation:** Aggregated key metrics such as spend, impressions, clicks, and conversion values by ad date, campaign, ad set, and media source.
- **Campaign and Ad Set Analysis:** Identified top-performing campaigns and ad sets based on ROMI and other KPIs, while also filtering out underperforming campaigns.
- **UTM Campaign Analysis:** Analyzed UTM campaign performance by decoding URL parameters and calculating KPIs for each campaign.
- **Monthly KPI Tracking:** Tracked month-over-month changes in key metrics, providing insights into campaign performance trends over time.
- **Performance Segmentation:** Segmented data by media source, campaign, and ad set to identify the most effective segments.

## üìà Key Metrics Calculated
- **CPC (Cost Per Click):** Measures the average cost per click for each campaign.
- **CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions):** Indicates the cost per 1,000 ad impressions.
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate):** Percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks.
- **ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment):** Measures the return generated by campaigns relative to the amount spent.
